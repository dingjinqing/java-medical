  proportionIntervalTip: 'The ratio must be between 0 and 50%',
  proportionInterval: 'After the user initiates the bargaining, the amount that the first bargain can be cut off accounts for the proportion of the commodity price, and the ratio is randomly generated within the filling interval. If it is not filled in, it will be calculated according to the system rules. The default is empty. If it is empty, it means no filling. For example, if you fill in 20% to 50% and the price of the product is 100 yuan, the user will start bargaining. When you bargain for the first time, the system will randomly take the ratio range number, for example, 35% randomly, then the user will start the bargain for the first time. The bargaining amount is 100*35%* (system bargaining factor), and the system bargaining factor is calculated according to system logic. If the system bargaining factor is 0.5, the bargaining amount is 100*35%*0.5=17.5 yuan. That is, the user can cut himself off 17.5 yuan',
